This page will go over some of the features in the Extras menu, without too much detail.

***

## 1. Create and import XML file

This option allows you to automatically convert a QEMU config script previously generated by AutoPilot into an XML file compatible with **virt-manager** (Virtual Machine Manager), which is a GUI frontend that makes management of your VMs easier and nicer to work with. 

After conversion, you'll have the option to automatically import the XML file into virt-manager.

## 2. OpenCore Configuration Assistant

This tool allows you to mount your virtual OpenCore image as a disk on your host system, allowing you to edit the contents without ever booting your VM.

***

## 3. macOS Boot Argument Editor

This tool allows you to seamlessly edit your macOS OpenCore boot arguments - letting you apply patches for things like GPU output.

It even includes a feature called **AutoPatch**, containing a list of known boot argument patches. You can select one, and the tool will instantly apply the relevant boot patch for your system. For example, you can apply the **Navi RX 5000 / 6000 black screen** patch automatically!

For more on this, and available patches, visit [this page](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/macOS-Boot-Argument-Editor).

## 4. GRUB Argument Editor

For users who use GRUB to boot their host's Linux install, setting the right kernel parameters can sometimes be a daunting mess. With this tool, most of this stress is taken care of automatically, through the auto-configuration of parameters **based on your specific system!**

## 5. Generate SMBIOS / Serial Number

ULTMOS now has built-in support for CorpNewt's [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) script, allowing you to automatically change your OpenCore's SMBIOS model and serial number - so you can customise the virtual Mac model and log into iServices, etc.

***

## C. Cleanup Tools...

This utility is a powerful uninstaller for Ultimate macOS KVM that provides the following functions:

1. **Clean Downloaded Files**: Removes all macOS recovery images and installation files that were downloaded during setup.

2. **Uninstall Ultimate macOS KVM (Keep VM Disks)**: Completely removes Ultimate macOS KVM from your system but backs up your virtual disk images to your home directory.

3. **Uninstall Ultimate macOS KVM (Remove Everything)**: Performs a complete self-destructing uninstallation that removes Ultimate macOS KVM and all associated files, including virtual disk images.

The uninstaller can be run interactively with a user-friendly menu or via command-line:
- `./scripts/cleanup.py --downloads` - Clean only downloaded macOS images
- `./scripts/cleanup.py --keep-data` - Uninstall Ultimate macOS KVM but back up your VM disks
- `./scripts/cleanup.py` - Complete uninstallation (interactive mode)
- Add `--force` to any command to skip confirmation prompts

> [!WARNING]
> The uninstall function is permanent and cannot be undone. Virtual disk backups (if selected) will be stored in your home directory.
>
> The uninstaller will also detect and offer to remove any Ultimate macOS KVM VMs that were imported into virt-manager.
