This page will go over some of the features in the Extras menu, without too much detail.

***

## 1. Create and import XML file

This option allows you to automatically convert a QEMU config script previously generated by AutoPilot into an XML file compatible with **virt-manager** (Virtual Machine Manager), which is a GUI frontend that makes management of your VMs easier and nicer to work with. 

After conversion, you'll have the option to automatically import the XML file into virt-manager.

## 2. OpenCore Configuration Assistant

This tool allows you to mount your virtual OpenCore image as a disk on your host system, allowing you to edit the contents without ever booting your VM.

***

## 3. macOS Boot Argument Editor

This tool allows you to seamlessly edit your macOS OpenCore boot arguments - letting you apply patches for things like GPU output.

It even includes a feature called **AutoPatch**, containing a list of known boot argument patches. You can select one, and the tool will instantly apply the relevant boot patch for your system. For example, you can apply the **Navi RX 5000 / 6000 black screen** patch automatically!

For more on this, and available patches, visit [this page](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/macOS-Boot-Argument-Editor).

## 4. GRUB Argument Editor

For users who use GRUB to boot their host's Linux install, setting the right kernel parameters can sometimes be a daunting mess. With this tool, most of this stress is taken care of automatically, through the auto-configuration of parameters **based on your specific system!**

## 5. Generate SMBIOS / Serial Number

ULTMOS now has built-in support for CorpNewt's [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) script, allowing you to automatically change your OpenCore's SMBIOS model and serial number - so you can customise the virtual Mac model and log into iServices, etc.

***

## R. Restore tools...

This opens a seperate menu providing options to restore various parts of the repository to defaults.

Great for troubleshooting common issues and covering up your mess.

***

## I. Report an issue...

Opens a new issue page on the GitHub repo in your default browser.
