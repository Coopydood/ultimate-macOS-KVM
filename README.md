<h3>macOS Sequoia Support<br><sub>Available Now</sub></h3>

macOS Sequoia has not yet been tested extensively, but it has been **confirmed to install and boot with the current version of ULTMOS** on the latest macOS version.

<br>

**AutoPilot now has an additional option for macOS Sequoia!** <br>Please feel free to try out the macOS Sequoia with ULTMOS and leave feedback on how it went!

## 👋》Introduction

Tired of all the restraints and poor performance of macOS VMs in hypervisors like VirtualBox or VMware? Well, the story changes when you run your virtual machines in **kernel space**. Welcome to the world of **K**ernel **V**irtual **M**achines.

You might be new to QEMU/KVM, or a long-time veteran - either way, this project aims to help you build a macOS virtual machine that can take full advantage of the power of KVM - but in a user-friendly and approachable way.

Scripts? Configs? QEMU arguments? A *"qcow"* file? *Moo?* If you need a little help wrapping your head around this stuff, feel free to check out the [FAQs](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/FAQs) for some quick knowledge on the basics.

## 🎲》Requirements

As with all other virtual machines / hypervisors, you don't need an *uber-powerful* PC, but you should expect guest performance to be relative to your host's. Performance *can* change dramatically based on guest properties, such as virtual cores, allocated memory, and virtual CPU threads - but it really does boil down to how beefy your host's hardware is.

Here's a table with my best judgment on minimum, recommended, and best system requirements:

## 🐧》Oh, and you NEED Linux.

Shocker; KVM is a module built into the *Linux kernel*, not **Windows Subsystem for Linux** or some UNIX-like terminal. You need a <ins>full install</ins> of at least base Linux **on your host**. Don't try any of that VM inception shenanigans.

The easiest way to do this is by grabbing some mainstream Linux distro, like **Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro, EndeavourOS** - among many, many others. You can theoretically pick any one you like. *I use Arch BTW.*

> [!NOTE]
> Testing of ULTMOS on different distrobutions is underway - but please note that is has been primarily developed and tested on **Arch** and **Debian**-based systems.

***

## 🛫》Getting Started

It's easy to get up and running. Simply clone the repo using ``git``.
Make sure you have **all** [dependencies](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/blob/main/README.md#requirements) installed before getting started.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM
```

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

<br>

Okay, so you've cloned my repo, and `cd`'d into the directory. Great!
Now, before running the script - and to avoid the subsequent and inevitable gotcha - you should enable the ``libvirtd`` daemon first if it hasn't been already. Here's an example for Arch-based systems:

```sh
$ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
```
> [!WARNING]
> This command requires superuser privileges.

<br>

and/or check the status of the daemon with

```sh
$ systemctl status libvirtd
```

***

## 🧭》Usage

Okay, now you're ready to use **ultimate-macOS-KVM**. Use the ``main.py`` file.

This is your main menu / central hub for the project and everything can be accessed from here. 

```sh
$ ./main.py
```
> [!CAUTION]
> Most sub-scripts included in the project should *not* be run on their own. Always use ``main.py`` unless the script was user-generated or stated otherwise.

***

## 🖥️》I'm here for GPU passthrough

...and you've come to the right place. ultimate-macOS-KVM includes several handy built-in tools to make VFIO-PCI passthrough (including GPUs) as pain-free as possible. Please see the documentation on how to get started with these tools.

> [!TIP]
> If you're looking for single GPU passthrough, DarknessRafix has an *excellent* guide that walks you through the process of setting this up using ULTMOS. You can read it [here](https://gitlab.com/DarknessRafix/macosvmgpupass).

Oh, and speaking of...

## 🛟》Help and Troubleshooting

Alongside the tutorial and explanation documents, this project includes troubleshooting guides for a wide variety of issues - ranging from project issues such as those in *AutoPilot*, or other issues such as GPU passthrough.

You can search for your problem and find solutions in the [**Issues and Troubleshooting**](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/Issues-and-Troubleshooting) section of the project wiki.

> [!NOTE]
> If an unexpected problem with the ULTMOS project itself arises, it may be a bug, and can be reported [here](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/issues/new).

***

## ⬇️》Updates

This project has been designed to be updated and made better over time.

As you use it to generate your personal files, having to re-clone the entire repo yourself while preserving your files would be a right pain in the backside. Therefore, there's an automated updater script built right in that you can use to safely update in-place to newer versions of this project, without affecting any of your personal config files, virtual hard drives, or anything else not part of the project files. And, if an update dramatically changes directory structures from your current version, the updater automatically disables its in-place update mechanism to prevent data loss.

Of course, if you're just testing the project, then a "clean install" is probably still preferable.

Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated and reviewed thoroughly, even if they don't make it into the project. The mere fact you took an interest in my project is awesome enough!

**However, when making code contributions, you MUST open your pull requests on the `dev` branch.** For safety reasons, the main branch is protected and pull requests directly to it will be denied. It's not personal - the protection is more to stop me from accidentally nuking the whole project or something.

## ☢️》Disclaimer

This is my way of giving back to the QEMU, KVM, and VFIO community. Please don't expect much as this is a passion project and not a priority in my life.

- I'm not responsible for any time you waste using this project.
- I'm not responsible if you make an oopsie whoopsie.
- I have no affiliation with OpenCore and have no developmental experience with it.
- Expect headaches. Some severe.
- You need a LOT of patience. I mean it. Despite me trying to alleviate some of the hassles, you WILL run into [stupid gotchas](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM/wiki/Issues-and-Troubleshooting) that require trial and error out of my control.
- I'm by no means an expert on this stuff nor would I claim to be.
- I've simply made *what I had to go through **easier** for you*. Hopefully.
- Yes, my Python is pretty bad. But if it works, it works.

> Do NOT run anything as ``sudo`` unless absolutely necessary. If you have an urge to then you need to break that habit _**asap.**_ <br><br>
> Most of my scripts do not require superuser privileges, however, the ones that do are clearly marked with a yellow ⚠️ next to the operation requiring such permissions.

## ⚖️》Legal

> [!WARNING]
> This project contains a string of text known as an OS Key (OSK). 

Apple uses this key to make it more difficult for non-Macintosh computers to run macOS, by requiring the key to be provided by the SMBIOS. 

This OS key is widely available on the Internet and is no longer considered a "secret", and was even included in a [public court document](http://www.rcfp.org/sites/default/files/docs/20120105_202426_apple_sealing.pdf).

Apple has attempted to classify the OSK as a trade secret but has ultimately failed in doing so. As a result, it is freely included within this project, as with [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM).

## 🤝》Credits & Greetz

While I am the creator of these automation/ease-of-use scripts, this project is not possible without both the prior and current works of some very talented people. The people who have tested the project are also included.

- **[Dortania](https://github.com/Dortania)** 》 Extensive documentation and Hackintosh development.
- **[Kholia](https://github.com/kholia)** 》 Development of scripts and documentation. ultimate-macOS-KVM is intended as an extension to [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM).
- **[thenickdude](https://github.com/thenickdude)** 》 Personal support throughout my KVM misadventures and countless community contribs.
- **[vit9696](https://github.com/vit9696)** 》 Author of many macOS hacks including kexts, and other source material used in this project. Probably knows the macOS boot process better than Apple.
- **[vu1tur](to@vu1tur.eu.org)** 》 Open source dmg to img conversion tool; used and bundled in this project.
- **[Eversiege](https://github.com/eversiege)** 》 Support and testing, та мій улюблений українець. Also made the project's main [website](https://coopydood.github.io/ultimate-macOS-KVM).
- **[CyberneticSquid](https://github.com/cyberneticsquid)** 》 Testing for me at stupid-o'-clock because he's a cool Aussie.
- **[Cake](https://github.com/cam-jm)** 》 Another Aussie testing for me in the middle of my sleep-deprived nights, with a slight obsession over cake.
- **[Hyperchromiac](https://github.com/hyperchromiac)** 》 My personal constitution-munching American. Legend has it that I live in his attic, although even I'm not sure. Love this guy either way.
- **[Kaz](https://github.com/Eaz11)** 》 Other than his brilliant English accent's pronunciations (including "macOS Syria"), he's done extensive testing. Say hi to your nephew for me.
- **[GigantTech](https://twitter.com/TechGigant)** 》 Moderately annoying German guy that I convinced to install Linux subsequently letting him test my project. It's free real estate!
- **[Hummenix](https://github.com/Hummenix)** 》Testing of ULTMOS across different Linux distros. 
- **[CorpNewt](https://github.com/CorpNewt)** 》Creator of GenSMBIOS and many other Hackintosh essentials.
- **[Acidanthera](https://github.com/Acidanthera)** 》The group behind OpenCore, Lilu, WhateverGreen, and MUCH more.
- **[DarknessRafix]()** 》Extensive testing of the project and the author of some excellent ULTMOS guides! Oh, and was the very first person to install macOS Sequoia on ULTMOS - even before me.
- **[kunihir0](https://github.com/kunihir0)** 》Responsible for several bug fixes and core feature updates.
